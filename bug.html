<body>
  <div id="myDiv">
    This text should be visible.
  </div>

  <script>
    // This is where the bug lies. The script attempts to modify the content
    // of the div, but the way it's done leads to an unexpected behavior.
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "This text replaces the original content. ";
    // The bug is that it doesn't allow for dynamic content update if the innerHTML is not properly constructed. 
    // For example, adding an event handler with javascript's addEventListener() method, does not get applied properly. 
    // this could lead to an unexpected behavior. In some cases, the updated content might not be rendered immediately.
    // The issue becomes apparent if you try to manipulate the DOM further after setting the innerHTML.
  </script>
